# arch-scripts
Where I keep scripts for automating some processes under Arch Linux. Run the `cpsh` function in the Shell/shell.sh script, to copy these scripts to the appropriate locations on your system so that they are automatically loaded for both standard and root users.

Run the following to install this repo on your Arch machine:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -cqO- https://git.io/vaKlX)"
```
