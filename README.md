# arch-scripts
Where I keep scripts for automating some processes under Arch Linux.

This repository contains a [common-scripts](https://github.com/fusion809/common-scripts) submodule that is required in order for these scripts to work properly. In order to clone this repository and the common-scripts submodule run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/fusion809/arch-scripts
```
